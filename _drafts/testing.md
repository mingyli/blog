# Header 1

This is a test page designed to be used during development, to make sure that
the custom CSS covers all the kinds of Kramdown supports. For example,
this text **should be bold** and this text *should be italic*. Meanwhile, this
represents `inline code` and this represents a [hyperlink](#header-2).
This is a footnote.[^1] This is a footnote.[^footnote]

## Header 2

This is a term
: this is a definition
: this is another definition

- a list
- with
- no nesting

End of first list

- nested list
    - nested
- another point
    - nested again

And then another list: 

- this time with paragraphs and nesting

  this is another paragraph

- some random point

  another point

1.  Point 1
2.  Point 2

What about mixing the two?

1. Point 1
    - first bullet
    - second bullet

2. Point 2
    - third bullet
    - fourth bullet

1. Hm
    - is
    - this
        - nested
            - or 
        - not

    // solve F(t, 0) subproblems first
    for (int t = 0; t <= T; t++) {
        // F(t, 0) = F(t - A, 0) or F(t - B, 0)
        if (t - A >= 0 && full[t - A][0])
            full[t][0] = true;
        if (t - B >= 0 && full[t - B][0])
            full[t][0] = true;
    }

    // solve F(t, 1) subproblems
    // we'll ignore bounds checks for simplicity
    for (int t = 0; t <= T; t++) {
        full[t][1] = full[t - A][1] || full[t - B][1]
                || full[2 * t][0] || full[2 * t + 1][0];
    }

    // return the largest value of t that Bessie can reach
    for (int t = T; t >= 0; t--)
        if (full[t][0] || full[t][1])
            return t;
    return 0;
